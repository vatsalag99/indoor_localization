# Indoor Locationing 

The goal of this project was to use machine learning and deep learning for indoor locationing using Wi-Fi fingerprints. Three models were trained (random_forest, k-NN, DNN) in Python using Scikit-learn and Keras to predict user location. Error analysis is also done using confidence ellipse estimation.
